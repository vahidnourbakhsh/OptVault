    Solves a transportation problem using Lagrangian relaxation and a subgradient method.

    This method relaxes the demand constraints and iteratively updates Lagrange multipliers
    to find a tight lower bound for the original problem.

    Args:
        costs (np.array): Matrix of transportation costs c_ij.
        supply (np.array): Vector of source supplies s_i.
        demand (np.array): Vector of destination demands d_j.
        max_iter (int): Maximum number of subgradient iterations.
        tolerance (float): Stopping tolerance for the subgradient norm.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - x (np.array): The optimal flow matrix from the final subproblem.
            - best_lower_bound (float): The best lower bound found.
